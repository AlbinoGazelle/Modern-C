This is my collection of completed programming projects from the book "C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition" by Kim King.

All programs were compiled with [gcc](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/) 9.2.0 on Windows 10 using `gcc -o output source.c`.

Certain projects require code from the book itself, for this reason I have included book-copyright.txt to cover that.

All other code is licensed under the MIT License.
